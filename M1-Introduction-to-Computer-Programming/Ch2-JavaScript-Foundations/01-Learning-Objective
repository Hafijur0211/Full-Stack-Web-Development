Learning Objective
Introduction
JavaScript, the versatile programming language, empowers you with decision statements like if-else and switch for handling conditions, and offers loops like for and while to tackle repetitive tasks. Delve into its array and string manipulation prowess, and master objects and JSON to organize data and create interactive web experiences.
Focus: Decision Statements, Loops & Control statements, Arrays & Strings, Objects & JSON, Functions, Asynchronous coding in JavaScript, Basics of OOPS in JavaScript
Prerequisites: VS Code IDE with Node.js installed, JavaScript Basics
Theme
Let's imagine a company called Bookstore that sells books online. The Bookstore company can have functions like searchBook(), addToCart(), and checkout() are used for specific tasks on the website. The company checks book availability using if-else statements and displays details if the book is in stock. An array of books is maintained and iterated through with a for loop to show available book details.
Strings are manipulated to format book information, while asynchronous JavaScript ensures a smooth checkout process without blocking the user interface. A while loop prompts the user for necessary information until all fields are filled.
Switch cases handle different payment options during checkout, displaying the appropriate form based on the selection. OOPS principles are implemented through classes like Book, Customer, and Order, facilitating better organization, encapsulation, and modularity of the code.
Primary Goals
Master functions, including handling arguments, return values, and grasping function scope and closures.
Understand conditional statements with if-else statements for decision-making in code.
Utilize for loops efficiently to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks.
Learn array and string manipulation techniques, such as accessing, modifying, and performing operations like searching and sorting.
Explore asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await for non-blocking tasks. Additionally, familiarize yourself with while loops, do-while loops, switch cases, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
