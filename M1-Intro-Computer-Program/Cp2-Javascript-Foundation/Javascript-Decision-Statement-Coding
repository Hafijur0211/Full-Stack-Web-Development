Palindrome Strings
Easy
Sarah is a web developer who wants to create a JavaScript function to check if a given string is a palindrome. She wants to use this function to build a feature that validates whether user input is a palindrome.

Help Sarah by writing a JavaScript function named isPalindrome that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input:
"racecar"

Output:
true

Example 2:
Input:
"hello"

Output:
false




Disney's Cinderella
Easy
Disney's Cinderella has a collection of glass slippers that she wants to organize in a particular order. She wants the slippers to be sorted in increasing order of their size, from the smallest to the largest.

Write a JavaScript function named sortSlippers that takes in one parameter:

slippers: an array of n integers (0 ≤ slippers[i] ≤ 100), representing the size of each glass slipper in Cinderella's collection.
The function should return a new array containing the same integers as the input array, but sorted in increasing order of their size.

Example 1:
Input:
[10, 7, 25, 14]

Output:
[7,10,14,25]

Example 2:
Input:
[7, 9, 5, 11]

Output:
[5, 7, 9, 11]

// Do not remove nor make any changes in  main() function
function main() {
    var slippers = readLine().split(" ").map(x => parseInt(x));
    console.log(sortSlippers(slippers));
}
function sortSlippers(slippers) {
  // Your code goes here
  return slippers.sort((a,b) => a -b);
}

Example 1:
Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output:
5

Example 2:
Input:
[10, 7, 25, 14]

Output:
