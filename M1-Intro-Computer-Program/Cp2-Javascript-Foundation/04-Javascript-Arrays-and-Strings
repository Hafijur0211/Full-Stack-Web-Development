Theme
E-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart use an array to store a customer's shopping cart. The shopping cart can be represented as an array of items containing information such as the product name, price, and quantity.

As a customer selects an item to purchase, the relevant information for that item is added to an array using the push() method. When the customer updates the quantity of an item, the item information in the array can be updated accordingly. The total cost of the items in the cart can be calculated by looping through the array and summing up the price of each item multiplied by its quantity.

Using a JavaScript Array to represent the shopping cart, the company can efficiently manage and manipulate the customer's order, allowing for a smooth and seamless shopping experience.

Primary Goals
Understand what Arrays are and work in JavaScript.
Learn Arrays creation, using their properties, methods, and various in-built functions available with JavaScript.
Learn how to perform operations on arrays.


JavaScript Arrays and Strings
Samantha was tasked with creating a reservation system for a popular tourist attraction. To make the system more user-friendly and efficient, she decided to use Arrays and Strings in JavaScript.

Samantha created an array of dates to represent the days that the attraction was open. She then used a loop to iterate through the array and check which dates were available for reservations. If a date was available, it was added to a separate array, which was used to populate the calendar on the reservation page.

To allow customers to easily select the number of tickets they wanted to purchase, Samantha used Strings to create a drop-down menu. The menu was dynamically populated based on the number of available tickets for the selected date, which was stored in an array. This allowed for a smooth and streamlined reservation process.

Thanks to Samantha's use of Arrays and Strings in JavaScript, the reservation system was a success. Customers were able to easily select their desired dates and purchase tickets, and the system was efficient and organized for the attraction's staff.

JavaScript Array
A JavaScript array is an object that can store multiple values. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element in the array is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

For example,

const words = ['hello', 'world', 'almabetter'];
Here, words is an array. The array stores three values.

JavaScript Array indexing
In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed, which means that the initial element is positioned at index 0, followed by the second element at index 1, and this pattern continues sequentially. In order to access an element in an array, you can use the array name followed by square brackets enclosing the index of the desired element.
Here's an example of creating an array and accessing its elements using indices:


Array Operations
Creating an Array
In JavaScript, there are two ways to create an array:

Array literal
This is the most common way to create an array, using square brackets [] and placing the array elements inside the brackets, separated by commas. 

For example,

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];


Array Constructor
An alternative method to create an array involves using the Array() constructor with the new keyword. With this approach, the length of the array needs to be specified as an argument.

let numbers = new Array(3); // creates an empty array with a length of 3


Note: It is recommended to create arrays using array literals instead of other methods.



An array in JavaScript can contain not only simple data types but also more complex ones, such as arrays, functions, and other objects. 

For example,

let myArray = [
  1, "Hello", true, [2, 4, 6],
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
  },
  function() {
    console.log("This is a function inside an array");
  }
];

console.log(myArray[3][1]); // Output: 4

myArray[5](); // Output: This is a function inside an array
Accessing Array Elements
Accessing array elements is possible using indices starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element.

For example,

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

console.log(fruits[0]); // output: "apple"
console.log(fruits[1]); // output: "banana"
console.log(fruits[2]); // output: "orange"
Adding Element to an Array
One of the ways to add elements to an array is by using built-in methods such as push() and unshift(). 

The push() method inserts an element to the array's last index.

For example,

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];

// adds an element to the array end
myArray.push(4);

console.log(myArray); // output is: [1, 2, 3, 4]
The unshift() method inserts an element at the beginning of the array. 

For example,

const fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange'];
console.log(fruits); // ['banana', 'apple', 'orange']

fruits.unshift('grape');
console.log(fruits); // ['grape', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange']
Changing Array Elements
You can also modify elements or add new ones by accessing them through their index value in the array.

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
console.log(fruits); // output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

fruits[1] = 'pear';
console.log(fruits); // output: ['apple', 'pear', 'cherry']

fruits[3] = 'orange';
console.log(fruits); // output: ['apple', 'pear', 'cherry', 'orange']
Visualize this code here

Suppose an array has three elements. If you try to insert an element at index 4 (fifth element), the fourth element will be undefined.

For example,

let dailyActivities = [ 'eat', 'sleep', 'play'];

// this will add the new element 'running' at the 4 index
dailyActivities[4] = 'running';

console.log(dailyActivities); // ["eat", "sleep", "play", undefined, "running"]
If you attempt to add elements to higher indices, the indices in between will have an undefined value.

Removing Array Element 
By using the pop() method, you can remove the final element from the array while also receiving its returned value.

For example,

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let removedFruit = fruits.pop();  // removes 'orange' from the array and returns it
console.log(fruits);              // prints ['apple', 'banana']
console.log(removedFruit);        // prints 'orange'
The shift() method will remove the first element and returns the removed element as its returned value.

For example,

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let removedFruit = fruits.shift();

console.log(fruits);         // Output: ['banana', 'orange']
console.log(removedFruit);   // Output: 'apple'
Length of an Array
The length of an array can be obtained using the length property of the array.

For example,

let myArray = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

console.log(myArray.length); // Output: 3


Activity 1
True or False:

Arrays in JavaScript can hold values of different data types.
JavaScript arrays have a fixed length that cannot be changed once created
The length property of a JavaScript array returns the number of elements in the array.
The push() method adds elements to the beginning of a JavaScript array.
JavaScript arrays are always zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0.
Arrays in JavaScript can be nested, meaning you can have an array within another array.
Answers
True. In JavaScript, arrays are not limited to holding values of a single data type. They can store values of different types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and even other arrays. This flexibility allows for versatile data structures and operations.
False. JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning their length can be changed after creation. You can add or remove elements from an array using various methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), and more. This dynamic nature makes arrays highly adaptable for managing collections of data.
True. The length property of a JavaScript array gives the number of elements present in the array. It returns an integer value representing the length or size of the array. This property can be useful for iterating over the elements or checking the size of an array.
False. The push() method in JavaScript is used to add elements to the end of an array, not the beginning. When you invoke push() on an array, you can provide one or more elements as arguments, and they will be appended to the end of the array. The length of the array will be updated accordingly.
True. Arrays are zero-indexed, which means the first element is accessed using an index of 0. For example, if you have an array arr, the first element would be arr[0], the second element would be arr[1], and so on. This convention is important to remember when working with arrays to avoid off-by-one errors.
True. JavaScript arrays can contain elements of any data type, including other arrays. This means you can create nested or multidimensional arrays by placing arrays as elements within an outer array.


Array Methods
JavaScript has several array methods that can be used to perform calculations and data manipulation. Some of the commonly used methods include:



Operation	Description	Example
push()	Appends one or multiple elements to the end of an array.	arr.push(4);
pop()	Eliminates the final element from an array, returning it.	const last = arr.pop();
shift()	Takes out the initial element from an array and gives it back.	const first = arr.shift();
unshift()	Inserts one or several elements at the start of an array.	arr.unshift(1);
slice()	Provides a shallow duplicate of a part of an array.	const subArr = arr.slice(1, 3);
splice()	Inserts and/or deletes elements within an array.	arr.splice(1, 0, 2, 3);
indexOf()	Gives back the first index where a specified element is located.	const index = arr.indexOf(3);
lastIndexOf()	Supplies the final index where a particular element is situated.	const lastIndex = arr.lastIndexOf(3);
includes()	Establishes if an array contains a specific element.	const isIncluded = arr.includes(2);
find()	Offers the initial element in the array that meets a certain criterion.	const found = arr.find(num => num > 2);
filter()	Forms a new array containing elements that pass a certain test.	const filtered = arr.filter(num => num > 2);
map()	Produces a new array by applying a function to each array element.	const doubled = arr.map(num => num * 2);
reduce()	Condenses an array into a single value using a function.	const sum = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
concat()	Unites two or more arrays into a fresh array.	const merged = arr1.concat(arr2);
join()	Combines all elements of an array into a single string.	const str = arr.join(', ');
reverse()	Inverts the sequence of the elements within an array.	arr.reverse();
Array Methods Examples
let numbers = [3, 5, 1, 8, 2];

// sort the array in ascending order
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers);             // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

// find the index of the element with value 5
let index = numbers.indexOf(5);
console.log(index);               // 3

// adding elements to array's end
numbers.push(4, 7);
console.log(numbers);             // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 7]

// concatenate two arrays
let moreNumbers = [6, 9];
let allNumbers = numbers.concat(moreNumbers);
console.log(allNumbers);          // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 7, 6, 9]

// check if the array includes a certain element
let hasFive = allNumbers.includes(5);
console.log(hasFive);             // true

// find the first element that is satisfying a condition
let greaterThanFour = allNumbers.find(number => number > 4);
console.log(greaterThanFour);     // 5
Note that if the element is not in an array, indexOf() gives -1.


Do it Yourself
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'pear'];
Use the push() method to add a new element, grape to the end of the fruits array.
The pop() method removes the last element from the fruit array.
Use the shift() method to remove the first element from the fruits array.
Solution
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'pear'];

// 1. Use the push() method to add a new element, 'grape', to the end of the fruits array.
fruits.push('grape');
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'pear', 'grape']

// 2. The pop() method removes the last element from the fruit array.
fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'pear']

// 3. Use the shift() method to remove the first element from the fruits array.
fruits.shift();
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'pear']


Working of JavaScript Array
Arrays in JavaScript are implemented as objects and their indices are treated as object keys.

As arrays are objects, their elements are stored as references, so when an array is copied, any modification to it will also be reflected in an original array.

For example,

let arr = [{name: 'John'}, {name: 'Jane'}];
let arr1 = arr;
arr1.push({name: 'Bob'});

console.log(arr); // [{name: 'John'}, {name: 'Jane'}, {name: 'Bob'}]
console.log(arr1); // [{name: 'John'}, {name: 'Jane'}, {name: 'Bob'}]

arr[0].name = 'Mike';
console.log(arr); // [{name: 'Mike'}, {name: 'Jane'}, {name: 'Bob'}]
console.log(arr1); // [{name: 'Mike'}, {name: 'Jane'}, {name: 'Bob'}]


You can also store values by passing a named key in an array.

For example,

let arr = ['h', 'e'];
arr.name = 'John';

console.log(arr); // ["h", "e"]
console.log(arr.name); // "John"
console.log(arr['name']); // "John"
Multidimensional Array
A multidimensional array is an array that holds one or more arrays as its elements. For instance,

// multidimensional array
const matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];
Create a Multidimensional Array
In this example, we have created a 2-dimensional array called myArray with three rows and two columns. Each row is an array containing two strings.

const myArray = [];
myArray.push(["apple", "orange"]);
myArray.push(["grape", "pear"]);
myArray.push(["pineapple", "mango"]);

console.log(myArray);   

/* Output
[["apple", "orange"], ["grape", "pear"], ["pineapple", "mango"]]
*/
Access Elements of Multidimensional Array
The elements belonging to the multidimensional array can be accessed using indices (0, 1, 2, etc.).

For example,

let x = [
['Jack', 24],
['Sara', 25],
['Peter', 26]
];

// accessing the first item
console.log(x[0]); // ["Jack", 24]

// accessing the first item of the first inner array
console.log(x[0][0]); // Jack

// accessing the second item of the third inner array
console.log(x[2][1]); // 26


One way to conceptualize a multi-dimensional array, such as 'x', is to view it as a table with 3 rows and 2 columns.


Add an Element to Multidimensional Array
Array's push() method or an indexing notation can be used to add elements to a multi-dimensional array.



Adding Element to the Outer Array

let studentData = [['Jack', 24], ['Sara', 23],];
studentsData.push(['Mark', 24]);

console.log(studentsData); //[["Jack", 24], ["Sara", 23], ["Mark", 24]


Adding Element to the Inner Array

Method 1:

// using index notation
let studentsData = [['Jak', 23], ['Sara', 24],];
studentsData[1][2] = 'hello';

console.log(studentsData); // [["Jack", 23], ["Sara", 24, "hello"]]
Method 2:

// using push()
let studentsData = [['Jack', 23], ['Sara', 24],];
studentsData[1].push('hello');

console.log(studentsData); // [["Jack", 23], ["Sara", 24, "hello dear"]]


An element can be added at a specific index using the splice() method of an array.

let studentsData = [['Sara', 23],['Jack', 24],];

// adding element at index 1
studentsData.splice(1, 0, ['Mark', 24]);

console.log(studentsData); // [['Sara', 23], ["Mark", 24], ['Jack', 24]]
Remove an Element from a Multidimensional Array
Array's pop() method can be used to remove an element from a multi-dimensional array. 

For example,

Remove Element from Outer Array

// removing an array element from outer array
let studentData = [['Jack', 25], ['Sara', 27],];
studentData.pop();

console.log(studentData); // [["Jack", 25]]


Remove Element from Inner Array

// removing an element from the inner array
let studentData = [['Jack', 25], ['Sarah', 23]];
studentData[1].pop();

console.log(studentData); // [["Jack", 25], ["Sarah"]]


Using the splice() method of an array, it is possible to remove an element at a particular index.

For example,

let studentsData = [['Jack', 24], ['Mark', 23]];

// removing 1 index array item
studentsData.splice(1,1);
console.log(studentsData); // [["Jack", 24]]
Iterating over Multidimensional Array
To iterate over a multidimensional array, you can use the forEach() method of the Array object.

For example,

let studentsData = [['Ryan', 24], ['Sara', 23],];

// iterating over the studentsData
studentsData.forEach((student) => {
    student.forEach((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    });
});

/* Output
Ryan
24
Sara
23
*/
The outer array elements are iterated using the first forEach() method, while the inner array elements are iterated using the second forEach() method.

Visualize this code here



Iterating over a multidimensional array can also be achieved using the for...of loop.

For example,

let studentsData = [['Ryan', 24], ['Sara', 23]];

for (let i of studentsData) {
  for (let j of i) {
    console.log(j);
  }
}


To iterate over a multidimensional array, you can also use a for() loop.

For example,

let studentsData = [['Ryan', 24], ['Sara', 27]];

// looping outer array elements
for(let i = 0; i < studentsData.length; i++){

    // gives the length of the inner array elements
    let innerArrayLength = studentsData[i].length;

    // looping inner array elements
    for(let j = 0; j < innerArrayLength; j++) {
        console.log(studentsData[i][j]);
    }
}

JavaScript String

A JavaScript string is made up of a sequence of UTF-16 units.
A JavaScript string is a type of primitive data that is used to manipulate text. 
For instance,

const name = 'John';
String Operations
Create JavaScript Strings
To create a string in JavaScript, surround the text with quotes. There are three options to choose from:

Single quotes: 'Hello, World'
Double quotes: "Hello, World"
Backticks: `Hello, World`
For example,

//strings example
let singleQuoteString = 'This is a string using single quotes.';
let doubleQuoteString = "This is a string using double quotes.";
let templateLiteralString = `This is a string using a template literal.`;
Single or double quotes are preferred, as they have practically the same function.



Backticks are commonly used to incorporate variables or expressions into a string. The ${} syntax is used to interpolate the values of the variables into the string.

const name = "Ryan";
const age = 28;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);

// Output: My name is Ryan and I am 28 years old.
Access String Characters
There are two ways to access the characters in a string.

One approach is to treat strings as if they were arrays.
const a = 'hello';
console.log(a[1]); // "e"
Another option is to use the charAt() method. 
const a = 'hello';
console.log(a.charAt(1)); // "e"
String Properties
JavaScript Strings are immutable
In JavaScript, strings are immutable, meaning their characters cannot be changed. 

let a = 'hello';
a[0] = 'H';
console.log(a); // "hello"


You can assign a variable name to a new string.

let a = 'hello';
a = 'Hello';
console.log(a); // "Hello"


JavaScript String is Case-Sensitive
It's important to remember that capitalizing letters matters. Lowercase and uppercase letters are treated as separate values. 

const a = 'a';
const b = 'A'
console.log(a === b); // false
In JavaScript, remember that a and A are considered distinct values.



JavaScript Multiline Strings
You have two options to use a multiline string: the + operator or the \\ operator. 

// using the + operator
const message1 = 'This is a long message ' +
    'that spans across multiple lines' +
    'in the code.'

// using the \ operator
const message2 = 'This is a long message \
that spans across multiple lines \
in the code.'


JavaScript String Length
To determine the length of a string, you can utilize the built-in length property. 

const a = 'hello';
console.log(a.length); // 5
JavaScript String Methods
Below are some commonly used methods for working with strings in JavaScript:



Method	Description	Example
length	Returns the length of the string	"hello".length returns 5
toUpperCase()	Returns the string with all characters converted to uppercase letters.	"hello".toUpperCase() returns "HELLO"
toLowerCase()	Returns the string with all characters converted to lowercase letters.	"HELLO".toLowerCase() returns "hello"
indexOf(substr)	Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the string	"hello".indexOf("e") returns 1
concat()	Joins two or more strings and returns a new string.	'hello'.concat(' ', 'world') returns 'hello world'
slice(start, [end])	Extracts a portion of the string and returns it as a new string	"hello".slice(1, 3) returns "el"
charAt(index)	Returns the character at a specified index in the string	"hello".charAt(1) returns "e"
replace(searchValue, replaceValue)	Replaces a substring in the string with another substring and returns the new string	"hello".replace("e", "a") returns "hallo"
split([separator])	Splits the string into an array of substrings, optionally using a separator	"hello world".split(" ") returns ["hello", "world"]
trim()	Removes whitespace from both ends of the string	" hello ".trim() returns "hello"
These methods provide various ways to manipulate strings in JavaScript, such as finding specific characters or substrings, joining multiple strings together, or converting a string to all lowercase or uppercase.



JavaScript String() Function
The String() function converts different data types to strings. 

For instance,

const a = 225; // number
const b = true; // boolean

//converting to string
const result1 = String(a);
const result2 = String(b);

console.log(result1); // "225"
console.log(result2); // "true"


Escape Character
To include special characters in a string, you can use the escape character \, also known as a backslash.

For example,

const name = 'My name is \'Peter\'.';
console.log(name);   // My name is 'Peter'.
Here are other ways that you can use \:



Code	Output
\”	include double quote
\\	include backslash
\n	new line
\r	carriage return
\v	vertical tab
\t	horizontal tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
The popularity of JavaScript has led to the development of many popular frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js.

JavaScript Arrays: Hidden Potential



Tackle these questions head-on!

Write a function getEvenNumbers using .filter() that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.
Write a function calculateAverage using .reduce() that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of all the numbers in the array.
Write a function duplicateElements using .copyWithin() that takes an array as input and duplicates the elements starting from a given index to the beginning of the array.
Write a function iterateArray that takes an array as input and uses the .values() method to iterate over the array and print each value.
Write a function printBooks that takes an array of book titles as input and uses the .forEach() method to print each book title.
Solution
// .filter() method
function getEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter(function(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0;
  });
}

// Test case
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
let evenNumbers = getEvenNumbers(numbers);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


Summary
What did we learn?
In JavaScript, you can create an array using the Array object or square brackets [].
Array elements are accessed using square brackets [] and the index element you would like to access.
JavaScript provides several built-in array methods, operations, and functions for working with arrays. Some commonly used methods include push, pop, shift, unshift, sort, reverse, splice, concat, slice, and indexOf.
Array operations include using the +operator to concatenate arrays and using the == and === operators to compare arrays.
In-built functions for arrays include Array.isArray(), Array.from(), Array.of(), Array.prototype.forEach(), Array.prototype.map(), Array.prototype.filter(), and Array.prototype.reduce().
A multi-dimensional array is an array that contains other arrays as its elements. You can create a multidimensional array by nesting arrays inside of each other. 
To access elements within a multidimensional array, you can use multiple square brackets representing a different dimension.
In JavaScript, arrays have several properties that provide information about their contents and behavior. Some of the most commonly used properties are length, constructor, prototype.
Shortcomings & Challenges
Inserting or deleting elements at the beginning of an array is slow because all elements have to be shifted to make room for the new elements or to fill the gap created by the removed elements.
The sort() method in JavaScript is unstable, meaning that elements with the same value may not maintain their original order after sorting.
Best Practices
Modifying an array while iterating over it can cause unpredictable results. Instead, copy the array or use a forEach method with a separate index to avoid modifying the array while iterating.
for...in is intended for use with objects and may not behave as expected when used with arrays. Use for...of or a regular for loop instead.
Use const or let when declaring arrays to avoid unexpected behavior caused by variable hoisting in JavaScript.
Choose the right data structure for your task, as arrays may not always be the best. For example, if you need to store key-value pairs, use a Map or Object instead of an array.
