Duration: 6 hours

Focus: Functional Programming, ES5 & ES6 modules, RegEx & Debugging in JavaScript

Prerequisites: Basic JavaScript, VS Code IDE

Theme
Imagine you're a master chef, but instead of pots and pans, your tools of choice are Functional Programming, ES5 & ES6 Concepts, RegEx & debugging in JavaScript. As you create culinary magic, functional programming empowers you to build modular recipes, each step a pure function ensuring consistency and scalability.

But wait, there's more! ES5 & ES6 Concepts bring a spice rack of features, like arrow functions and classes, allowing you to whip up flavorful code that's easier to read and maintain. Now, let's garnish your dish with RegEx. Just like a master spice blend, RegEx lets you precisely search and manipulate text patterns, ensuring your recipes have the perfect flavor. But hey, even the most skilled chef can encounter cooking mishaps. That's where debugging tools step in, helping you uncover and fix any hiccups, ensuring your dishes are flawless.

So put on your chef's hat and embrace this culinary adventure, where functional programming, ES5 & ES6 Concepts, RegEx, and debugging combine to create deliciously robust JavaScript recipes. Bon app√©tit!
