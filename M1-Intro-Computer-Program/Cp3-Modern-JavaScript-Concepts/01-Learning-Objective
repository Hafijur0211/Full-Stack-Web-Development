Learning Objective
Introduction
Improve your programming skills with functional programming for clean and scalable code. Enhance your knowledge with ES5 & ES6 concepts and master RegEx and debugging tools to efficiently handle text patterns and eliminate bugs.
Focus: Functional Programming, ES5 & ES6 modules, RegEx & Debugging in JavaScript
Prerequisites: VS Code IDE with Node.js installed, JavaScript Basics & Foundations
Theme
Imagine you're a master chef, but instead of pots and pans, your tools of choice are Functional Programming, ES5 & ES6 Concepts, RegEx & debugging in JavaScript. As you create culinary magic, Functional Programming empowers you to build modular recipes, each step a pure function ensuring consistency and scalability.
But wait, there's more! ES5 & ES6 Concepts bring a spice rack of features, like arrow functions and classes, allowing you to whip up flavorful code that's easier to read and maintain. Now, let's garnish your dish with RegEx. Just like a master spice blend, RegEx lets you precisely search and manipulate text patterns, ensuring your recipes have the perfect flavor. But hey, even the most skilled chef can encounter cooking mishaps. That's where debugging tools step in, helping you uncover and fix any hiccups, ensuring your dishes are flawless.
Primary Goals
Understand immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions, recursion, and composition.
Gain a solid understanding of functional programming's key elements for writing concise and robust code.
Familiarize yourself with ES5 & ES6 concepts to leverage modern JavaScript features.
