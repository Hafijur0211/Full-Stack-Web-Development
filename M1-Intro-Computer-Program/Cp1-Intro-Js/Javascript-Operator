Learning Objective
Introduction
A JavaScript operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more values (operands) and returns a result.

Duration: 2 Hours

Focus: JavaScript Operators, Different types of operators

Prerequisites: IDE with Node.js installed

Theme
JavaScript operators are used to manipulate data, just like kitchen tools that manipulate dishes. They help developers create the perfect program, just like a chef creates the perfect dish. From the + operator that combines values to the = operator that assigns values, each one has a unique function, like kitchen utensils.

Primary Goals
Understand the use and types of JavaScript Operators.
Gain hands-on knowledge on working with different operators.


JavaScript Operators
Imagine you are a cashier at a grocery store. You are responsible for scanning items and calculating the total cost for the customer. You use a computerized cash register that runs on JavaScript to achieve this. The cash register uses operators such as + and - to calculate the total cost of the items scanned and the change to be returned to the customer. 

For example, you might use the string "Bananas" to represent bananas and the operator + to add the price of bananas to the total cost. All of this is made possible by using the JavaScript operator.




What are JavaScript Operators?
An operator is a special symbol that performs operations on operands (values and variables).

For example,

console.log(2 + 3); // 5
+ is what we call an operator that does the adding, and 2 and 3 are the numbers we're adding together.

Operators are used to performing various operations.
Operators can be used to assign values, compare values, and perform arithmetic operations.

Assignment Operators
Values can be assigned to variables by making use of assignment operators. For example,

const x = 5;
To assign value 5 to variable x, you can use the = operator.

Below is a list of commonly used assignment operators:



Operator	Name	Example
=	Assignment operator	a = 7; // 7
+=	Addition assignment	a += 5; // a = a + 5
-=	Subtraction Assignment	a -= 2; // a = a - 2
*=	Multiplication Assignment	a *= 3; // a = a * 3
/=	Division Assignment	a /= 2; // a = a / 2
%=	Remainder Assignment	a %= 2; // a = a % 2
**=	Exponentiation Assignment	a **= 2; // a = square of a
Important: The most commonly used assignment operator is =. You will easily understand other assignment operators, such as +=, -=, and *=, once you study arithmetic operators in JavaScript.
Arithmetic Operators
Operators used for performing arithmetic calculations are known as Arithmetic Operators, which include the following:

const number = 3 + 5; // 8
When using the + operator in your code, you're basically adding two values together.





Operator	Name	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	a / b
%	Remainder	a % b
++	Increment (increment by 1)	x++ or ++x
--	Decrement (decrement by 1)	--x or x--
**	Exponentiation (Power)	a ** b
Example: Arithmetic operators in JavaScript

let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;

// addition
console.log('num1 + num2 = ', num1 + num2);  // 8

// subtraction
console.log('num1 - num2 = ', num1 - num2);  // 2

// multiplication
console.log('num1 * num2 = ', num1 * num2);  // 15

// division
console.log('num1 / num2 = ', num1 / num2);  // 1.6666666666666667

// remainder
console.log('num1 % num2 = ', num1 % num2);   // 2

// increment
console.log('++num1 = ', ++num1); // num1 is now 6
console.log('num1++ = ', num1++); // prints 6 and then increased to 7
console.log('num1 = ', num1);     // 7

// decrement
console.log('--num1 = ', --num1); // num1 is now 6
console.log('num1-- = ', num1--); // prints 6 and then decreased to 5
console.log('num1 = ', num1);     // 5

//exponentiation
console.log('num1 ** num2 =', num1 ** num2);
Increment(++) and Decrement(--) Operator
In JavaScript, the increment operator ++ adds 1 to a variable's value, while the decrement operator -- subtracts 1 from a variable's value.



Example: 

let num = 5

console.log(++num);          // num becomes 6 and prints 6
console.log(num++);          // Prints 6 and num becomes 7
console.log(num);            // Prints 7
console.log(--num);          // num becomes 6 and prints 6
console.log(num--);          // Prints 6 and num becomes 5
console.log(num);            // Prints 5
Explanation:

let num = 5; - Initializes the variable num with the value 5.
console.log(++num); - Pre-increment: The value of num is incremented by 1 first, making num equal to 6, and then the new value is printed. Output: 6.
console.log(num++); - Post-increment: The original value of num (which is now 6) is printed first, and then the value of num is incremented by 1, making num equal to 7. Output: 6.
console.log(num); - The current value of num is printed. Since num was incremented to 7 in the previous step, the output is 7.
console.log(--num); - Pre-decrement: The value of num is decremented by 1 first, making num equal to 6, and then the new value is printed. Output: 6.
console.log(num--); - Post-decrement: The original value of num (which is now 6) is printed first, and then the value of num is decremented by 1, making num equal to 5. Output: 6.
console.log(num); - The current value of num is printed. Since num was decremented to 5 in the previous step, the output is 5.
Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to comparing 2 values and then return a Boolean value, either true or false. For example,

const a = 3, b = 2;
console.log(a > b); // true
When using the comparison operator >, we confidently compare whether a is greater than b.



Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	5 == "5" returns true
===	Equal value and type	5 === "5" returns false
!=	Not equal to	5 != 6 returns true
!==	Not equal value or not equal type	5 !== "5" returns true
>	Greater than	6 > 5 returns true
>=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 5 returns true
<	Less than	5 < 6 returns true
<=	Less than or equal to	7 <= 5 returns false
Example: Comparison operators in JavaScript

// equal operator
console.log(2 == 2); // true
console.log(2 == '2'); // true

// not equal operator
console.log(3 != 2); // true
console.log('hello' != 'Hello'); // true

// strict equal operator
console.log(2 === 2); // true
console.log(2 === '2'); // false

// strict not equal operator
console.log(2 !== '2'); // true
console.log(2 !== 2); // false
Logical Operators
Logical operators are used for performing logical operations and return either true or false. 

For example,

const x = 5, y = 3;
(x < 6) && (y < 5); // true
The logical operator && is utilized in this code. With both x < 6 and y < 5 being true, the result of the operation is confidently true.



Operators	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND: true if both the operands are true ,else returns false	x && y
||	Logical OR: true if either of the operands is true ; returns false if both are false	x || y
!	Logical NOT: true if the operand is falseand vice-versa.	!x
Example: Logical Operators in JavaScript

// logical AND
console.log(true && true); // true
console.log(true && false); // false

// logical OR
console.log(true || false); // true

// logical NOT
console.log(!true); // false
Logical operators are used in decision-making and loops.

Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are employed to carry out operations on binary representations of numbers. 

Everyday programming rarely involves the use of bitwise operators.


Operator	Description	Example
&	AND	5 & 6 returns 4
|	OR	5 | 6 returns 7
^	XOR	5 ^ 6 returns 3
~	NOT	~5 returns -6
<<	Left shift	5 << 2 returns 20
>>	Right shift	5 >> 1 returns 2
>>>	Zero-fill right shift	5 >>> 1 returns 2
Example: Bitwise Operators in JavaScript

const a = 5; // 0101 in binary
const b = 3; // 0011 in binary

// Bitwise AND
console.log(a & b); // 1 (0001 in binary)

// Bitwise OR
console.log(a | b); // 7 (0111 in binary)

// Bitwise XOR
console.log(a ^ b); // 6 (0110 in binary)

// Bitwise NOT
console.log(~a); // -6 (1010 in binary)

// Left shift
console.log(a << 1); // 10 (1010 in binary)

// Right shift
console.log(a >> 1); // 2 (0010 in binary)
Try it Yourself
Agree or Disagree

When adding two negative numbers, the result is always negative.
The && (AND) operator returns true if both operands are true.
The XOR (^) operator returns true if both operands have the same value.
The modulus operator (%) returns the quotient of the division of two numbers.
The ! (NOT) operator returns true if the operand is false.

String Operators
In JavaScript, +operator is used to concatenate (join) two or more strings.



Example:

let str1 = "Hello";
let str2 = "world!";
let result = str1 + " " + str2; // concatenation using the + operator
console.log(result); // output: "Hello world!"


It's important to note that the + operator performs concatenation when used with strings but performs addition when used with numbers.

Other JavaScript Operators
Below is a list of additional operators that are available in JavaScript.



Operator	Description	Example
(condition) ? (if_true) : (else_false);	Ternary operator	x > 0 ? "positive" : "non-positive"
delete	Delete a property from an object	delete obj.prop
typeof	Returns the type of a value	typeof x
void	Evaluates an expression and returns undefined	void(0)
in	Checks if a property exists in an object	"prop" in obj
instanceof	Checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor function	x instanceof MyClass
Example: Ternary Operator

let age = 18;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes
In this example, we check if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18. If the statement's condition is true, the ternary operator returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No". The result is then stored in the canVote variable.

The same logic can be written using an if-else statement:

let age = 18;
let canVote;

if (age >= 18) {
  canVote = "Yes";
} else {
  canVote = "No";
}

console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes


Example: typeof Operator

const num = 42;
const str = "Hello, World!";
const bool = true;
const obj = { key: "value" };
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const func = function () {};
const und = undefined;
const nul = null;

console.log(typeof num);  // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof str);  // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof bool); // Output: "boolean"
console.log(typeof obj);  // Output: "object"
console.log(typeof arr);  // Output: "object" (arrays are objects in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof func); // Output: "function"
console.log(typeof und);  // Output: "undefined"
console.log(typeof nul);  // Output: "object" (this is considered a historical bug in JavaScript)

Summary
What did we learn?
JavaScript operators are symbols that perform actions on values and return a result. 
They are a fundamental aspect of the language and allow developers to perform operations such as arithmetic, comparison, and assignment.
Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Comparison operators are used for comparing two values and return a Boolean result (true or false). Examples include equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), and less than (<).
Assignment operators serve the purpose of assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is the equal sign (=).
Logical operators: These operators perform logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
Ternary operator: This operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement and returns one of two values based on a condition.
JavaScript provides a range of methods for working with strings. 
Some common methods include .length(to find the length of a string), .substring()(to extract a portion of a string), .indexOf()(to find the position of a substring), .toLowerCase()(to convert a string to lowercase), and .toUpperCase()(to convert a string to uppercase).
In JavaScript, there is a variety of built-in functions available to manipulate strings, including parseInt() for converting strings to integers, split() for dividing a string into an array of substrings, and replace() for substituting a substring within a string.
Shortcomings & Challenges
JavaScript has a type coercion feature, automatically converting values between data types. While this can be convenient sometimes, it can lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This can lead to issues when comparing strings for equality, and developers must know the case sensitivity when working with strings.
Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning that once you create a string, you can't change its characters. This can be inefficient and lead to performance issues, especially when working with large strings.
JavaScript provides a limited set of built-in methods for manipulating strings, which can make it difficult to perform complex string operations.
Best Practices
Be mindful of type coercion when working with strings and other data types in JavaScript. Always use strict equality operators (=== and !==) instead of loose equality operators (== and !=) to avoid unexpected results.
Choose single or double quotes and use them consistently throughout your code. This helps to avoid confusion and makes the code easier to read.
Consider using template literals instead of concatenation when working with strings, making it easier to build strings that include expressions or variables.
Store strings in variables whenever possible to make your code easier to maintain and modify.
Use shorthand operators (such as +=, -=, and *=) to write concise, readable code.
