Theme
Imagine Myntra needs to handle thousands of concurrent users and process millions of daily transactions. Developers can use Node.js and Express.js to build a high-performance API that can handle a large volume of requests while ensuring security through authentication and middleware functions. Organizations like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and LinkedIn use Node.js and Express.js to power their web and mobile applications, among other services.
Netflix uses Node.js for its server-side applications. One notable example is the Netflix UI, which heavily relies on Node.js and Express.js for handling user requests, data processing, and real-time interactions.
PayPal adopted Node.js and Express.js to build efficient and scalable server-side applications, APIs, and microservices, enabling faster development and better handling of high traffic.
Primary Goals
Learn how to build server-side applications using Node.js and Express.js. 
Understand how to handle HTTP requests, create RESTful APIs, and manage routes for different parts of your application.
Gain a solid understanding of Express.js middleware and routing.
Learn how to integrate databases, such as MongoDB, MySQL, etc with Node.js and Express.js.
