Learning Objective
Introduction
Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that store and retrieve data in a way that doesn't rely on the traditional tabular structure of rows and columns.
Focus: Non-Relational Database, MongoDB
Prerequisites: Basics of Database
Theme
Twitter relies on NoSQL databases to store tweets and associated data. Given the high volume of tweets generated every second, NoSQL databases can handle the scalability and flexibility required to store and retrieve tweets in real-time. To generate personalized timelines for each user, Twitter uses NoSQL databases to quickly fetch and assemble tweets from various sources. This allows them to serve up-to-date content to users as they scroll through their feeds.
Uber collects a massive amount of ride-related data, including GPS coordinates, driver and rider information, trip details, and more. NoSQL databases, particularly document-based or key-value stores, are used to efficiently store and manage this data. Uber heavily relies on geospatial data to match drivers with riders and calculate routes. NoSQL databases with geospatial indexing capabilities are used to optimize these processes for quick response times.
