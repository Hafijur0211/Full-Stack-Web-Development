Facebook utilizes React.js to power its user interface, enabling dynamic and interactive components on its platform. React's virtual DOM efficiently manages updates, allowing Facebook to handle large amounts of data and deliver a smooth user experience. React's component-based architecture also facilitates code reusability and maintainability, making it easier for Facebook's development teams to collaborate and iterate on features.
Airbnb employs React.js to build its user interface, enhancing the performance and user experience of its website and mobile apps. React's component-based approach enables Airbnb to create reusable UI elements, ensuring consistency across their platform. With React's efficient rendering and state management, Airbnb can deliver real-time updates and interactive features, such as search filtering and dynamic listings, providing a seamless booking experience for its users.
