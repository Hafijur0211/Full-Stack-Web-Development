Learning Objective
Introduction
Next.js is a robust framework that utilizes React, a JavaScript library for UI creation, to build web apps and sites. It streamlines the development of complex projects by offering tools for routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering.
Focus: Data fetching, Routing, Layouts & Styles, Optimization, Database, Security, Testing, and Deployment 
Pre-requisite: Web development and React.js fundamentals
Theme
Let's consider the scenario of developing an online learning platform where users can access educational courses, tutorials, and interactive content. Courses contain dynamic content (text, videos, quizzes) with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for real-time updates without rebuilding the site. The platform is responsive for desktop, tablet, and smartphone users. Client-side data fetching enables interactive features like progress tracking and note-taking without compromising performance.
Secure user authentication with role-based authorization is implemented using Next.js's libraries and middleware. SEO-friendly course pages are ensured with Next.js's server-side rendering for better search engine rankings. Performance optimization techniques, such as code splitting and lazy loading, provide fast loading and smooth interactions. Real-time collaboration features, like live sessions and discussion forums, are facilitated using Next.js capabilities. Comprehensive testing is performed with support for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Deployment on cloud services ensures scalability and availability.
Primary Goals
Understand different data fetching techniques in web development. Learn how to fetch data from APIs, databases, or CMS.
Learn how to handle routing (client-side routing and server-side routing) in web applications. 
Practice creating consistent and appealing layouts for web pages through various styling options, including CSS, CSS-in-JS, and CSS frameworks.
Learn essential security and testing techniques to protect web applications from vulnerabilities. Learn how to deploy web applications to production development.
