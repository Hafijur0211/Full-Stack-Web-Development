Spotify is a popular digital music streaming service that provides users access to a vast library of music, podcasts, and other audio content. The company's website and web player utilize the foundations of web design to deliver an immersive and user-friendly experience.
HTML forms the structure and backbone of Spotify's web pages. It defines the various elements and components of the website, such as navigation menus, search bars, album covers, track lists, and player controls. HTML ensures the content is organized, semantically structured, and accessible for users.
CSS plays a vital role in the visual presentation of Spotify's web interface.

CSS enables Spotify to create a visually appealing, consistent design that aligns with its brand identity.

The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
